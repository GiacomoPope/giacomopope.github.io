## Giacomo Pope (Jack)

- Co-founder of [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org): a free education platform for learning modern cryptography.
- Cryptography consultant with [NCC Group](https://cryptoservices.github.io/about/).
- Ph.D. in theoretical physics, my work was devoted to better understanding black hole solutions of *N=2* supergravity and their thermodynamics.
- Compete in CTFs with [Organizers](https://ctftime.org/team/42934).
    - I have included [Writeups](/writeups) for the challenges I have either written or solved from various CTFs.
