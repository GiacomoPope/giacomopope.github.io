# Writeups

Here is a collection of write ups and discussions of the challenges I have solved in various capture the flag competitions. The focus is usually the cryptographic challenges.

# About Me

## Giacomo (Jack) Pope

Recent PhD graduate from the University of Liverpool. My thesis was titled "Cosmological Killing Horizons and their Thermodynamics", and the main results of my thesis are split between my two papers linked above. 

I co-founded the website [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org) with [Hyperreality](https://github.com/hyperreality/ctf-writeups), and regularly play CTF competitions with [cr0wn](https://cr0wn.uk) and [Organizers](https://ctftime.org/team/42934). 

Currently, I am particularly interested in elliptic curve cryptography, so the writeups and blog posts I make will generally be focused on this area.
