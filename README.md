# Writeups

Here is a collection of write ups and discussions of the challenges I have solved in various capture the flag competitions. The focus is usually the cryptographic challenges.

## About Me

I am currently playing CTFs as a member of [cr0wn](https://cr0wn.uk) and I cofounded the website [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org) with [Hyperreality](https://github.com/hyperreality/ctf-writeups).

Currently I am particularly interested in elliptic curve cryptography, so the writeups I choose to discuss will generally be focused on this area.
