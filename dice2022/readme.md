# DiceCTF 2022

I played DiceCTF with my team [Organisers](https://org.anize.rs). We came first place. I wrote up two challenges for our website, I'm including them here just for completeness. To read more writeups for DiceCTF, have a look at the [Organisers' write-ups](https://org.anize.rs/dicectf-2022/).

### Solution

The challenge presents us with a verifiable delay function (VDF), which (if correctly implemented) requires us to compute

$$
h \equiv g^{2^T} \pmod n.
$$

This requires us to perform $T = 2^{64}$ squares of $g \pmod n$, which is totally infeasible for a weekend CTF! If we could factor $n$, we could first compute $a \equiv 2^T \pmod{\phi(n)}$, but as the challenge is set up, it's obvious we can't factor the 2048 bit modulus.

Another option would be to pick a generator $g$ of low order, for the RSA group $\mathcal{G} = (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$, two easy options are $g=1$ or $g=-1$. However, looking at `verify(g,h,pi)`, we see that these elements are explicitly excluded from being considered

```python
def is_valid(x):
    return type(x) == int and 0 < x < n

def verify(g, h, pi):
    assert is_valid(g)
    assert is_valid(h)
    assert is_valid(pi)
    assert g != 1 and g != n - 1
    m = H(g, h)
    r = pow(2, T, m)
    assert h == pow(pi, m, n) * pow(g, r, n) % n
```

 First `is_valid(x)` ensures that $g,h,\pi \in \mathcal{G}$ and then the additional check `assert g != 1 and g != n - 1` ensures that $g$ has unknown order. 

So if we can't run `prove(g)` in a reasonable amount of time, and we can't cheat the VDF by factoring, or selecting an element of known order, then there must be something within `verify` we can cheat.

First, let's look at what appears in `verify(g,h,pi)` and what we have control over. 

We choose as input any $g,h,\pi \in \mathcal{G}$ and from $g,h$ `shake128` is used as a pseudorandom function to generate $m$. Finally, from $m$ we find $r \equiv 2^T \pmod m$. 

To pass the test in verify, naively we need to send integers from the output of `h, pi = prove(g)` such that the following congruence holds:

$$
h \equiv g^r \cdot \pi^m \pmod n.
$$

Although this congruence assumes the input $(g,h,\pi)$ have the relationship established by `prove(g)`, what if we instead view this as a general congruence? Let's try by assuming all variables can be expressed as a power of a generator $b$ and attempt to forget about `prove(g)` altogether! For our implementation, we make the choice $b = 2$, but this is arbitary.

$$
g \equiv b^M \pmod n, \quad h \equiv b^A \pmod n, \quad \pi \equiv b^B \pmod n.
$$

From this point of view, we need to try and find integers $(M,A,B)$ such that

$$
b^A \equiv b^{rM} \cdot b^{mB} \pmod n \Leftarrow A = rM + mB
$$

The integers $(m,r)$ are generated from

```python
def H(g, h):
    return int.from_bytes(shake_128(encode(g) + encode(h)).digest(16), 'big')

# We can pick these
M, A, B = ?, ?, ?
g = pow(2,M,n)
h = pow(2,A,n)
pi = pow(2,B,n)

# Effectively random
m = H(g, h)
r = pow(2, T, m)
```

and we can effectively treat these integers as totally random. More importantly, the values are unknown until we make a choice for both $g,h$ (and therefore $M,A$). 

Our first simplification will be $A = 0 \Rightarrow h = 1$, which simplifies our equation and is a valid input for $h$. Now we need to pick $(M,B)$ such that

$$
0 = rM + mB,
$$

where we remember that the values of $(r,m)$ are only known after selecting $M$, but $B$ can be set afterwards. It then makes sense to rearrange the above equation into the form:

$$
B = -\frac{rM}{m}
$$

To find an integer solution $B$, we then need to find some $rM$ which is divisible by a random integer $m$. 

The VDF function which appears in the challenge is based off work by [Wesolowski](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/623), reviewed in a paper by [Boneh, BÃ¼nz and Fisch](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf). There is a key difference though between the paper and the challenge. In Wesolowski's work, $m$ is prime, and finding a $M$ divisible by some large, random prime is computationally hard. The challenge becomes solvable because $m$ is totally random and so can be composite. 

To find an integer $M \equiv 0 \pmod m$, the best chance we have is to use some very smooth integer, such as $M = n!$, or $M = \prod_i^n p_i$ as the product of the first $n$ primes. In the challenge author's [write-up](https://priv.pub/posts/dicectf-2022), they pick

$$
M = 256! \prod_i^n p_i,
$$

where they consider all primes $p_i < 10^{20}$. Including $256!$ allows for repeated small factors in $m$. In our solution, we find it is enough to simply take the product of all primes below $10^6$.

To then solve the congruence, we first generate a very smooth integer $M$ and set $g \equiv b^M \pmod n$. From this, we compute $m = H(g,1)$. If $M \equiv 0 \pmod m$ we break the loop, compute $r$ from $m$, then $B(M,r,m)$. Finally setting $\pi \equiv b^B \pmod n$ for our solution $(g,h,\pi)$. If the congruence doesn't hold, we square $g \equiv g^2 \pmod n$ and double $M = 2M$ for bookkeeping, and try again.

Sending our specially crafted $(g,h,\pi) = (g,1,\pi)$ to the server, we get the flag.

### Implementation

**Note:** We use `gmpy2` to speed up all the modular maths we need to do, but you can do this using python's `int` type and solve in a reasonable amount of time.

print(f'c1 = {hex(c1)}')
print(f'c2 = {hex(c2)}')
```

### Reading the Challenge

This challenge is based on a custom commitment scheme for RSA signatures. Before diving into the solution, let's break down what we're given and try and identify the insecure part of the scheme.

The RSA modulus $N=pq$ has 2048 bits, and is the product of two 1024 bit primes, which are generated such that $n = 5$ is not a factor of $(p-1)$ or $(q-1)$. From this alone, we will not be able to factor $N$. 

The public exponent is unusual: `e = 0xd4088c345ced64cbbf8444321ef2af8b`, but it's prime and not so large as to cause much suspicion. So far, so good (or bad for finding a solution, i suppose...).

We are given the length of the `flag` , which is 31 bytes or 248 bits long. The signature of the flag is $s = m^d \pmod N$, where $m$ is not padded before signing. This means that $m$ is relatively small compared to the modulus (Coppersmith should start being a thought we have now). However, we don't have the value of the signature, only the commitment.

The commitment gives us two values, $c_1$ and $c_2$. Let's look at how the commitment is made. 

```python
def commit(s, key, n):
    return (s + key) % N, pow(key, n, N)

r = randrange(1, N)
s = sign(flag)
c1, c2 = commit(s, r, n)
```

First a random number $r$ is generated from `r = randrange(1, N)` as the `key`. The flag is signed and so we are left with two integers $(r,s)$ both approximately of size $N$. The commitment is made by adding together these integers modulo $N$: 

$$
c_1 = (s + r) \pmod N.
$$

We can understand $r$ here as effectively being a OTP, obscuring the signature $s$. We cannot recover $s$ from $c_1$ without knowing $r$ and we cannot recover $r$ without knowing $s$.

The second part of the commitment depends only on the random number $r$ and is given by

$$
c_2 = r^5 \pmod N.
$$

Obtaining $r$ from $c_2$ is as hard as breaking RSA with the public key $(e=5,N)$. If $r$ was small, we could try taking the fifth root, but as it of the size of $N$, we cannot break $c_2$ to recover $r$.

So... either the challenge is impossible, or there's a way to use our knowledge of $(c_1,c_2)$ together to recover the flag. 

### Combining Commitments

Let's write down what we know algebraically:

$$
\begin{aligned}
s &= m^d  &&\pmod N, \\
c_1 &= s + r &&\pmod N, \\
c_2 &= r^5 &&\pmod N.
\end{aligned}
$$

Additionally, we know that $m$ is small with respect to $N$, so if we could write down a polynomial $g(m) = 0 \pmod N$, we could use Coppersmith's small roots to recover $m$ and hence the flag!

**Note**: The following solution was thought up by my teammate, [Esrever](https://twitter.com/esrever_25519), so all credit to him.

Consider the polynomial in the ring $R = (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})[X]$:

$$
f(X) = (c_1 - X)^e \pmod N,
$$

we have the great property that $f(r) = m$. However, written like this, the polynomial will be enormous, as $e$ is a (moderately) large prime [Maybe this is the reason $e$ was chosen to be in the form we see in the challenge].

Esrever's great idea was to work in the quotient ring $K = R[X] / (X^5 - c_2)$, using the additional information we get from $c_2$. This allows us to take the $e$ degree polynomial $f(X)$ and recover a (at most) degree four polynomial by repeatedly substituting in $X^5 = c_2$.

Taking powers of the polynomial, we have that

$$
m^k = f^k(r) = (c_1 - r)^{e\cdot k} \pmod N
$$

The hope was that by taking a set of these polynomials, we could write down a linear combination of $m^k$ such that all $r$ cancel, leaving a univariate polynomial in $m$. This is exactly what we need to find if we hope to solve using small roots.

We were able to accomplish this with a bit of linear algebra. Let's go through step by step.

### Linear Algebra to the Rescue

First let us write the $k^{\text{th}}$ power of $f(X)$ as $f^k(X)$ with coefficients $b_{ki}$: 

$$
f^k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{4} b_{ki} \cdot X^i
$$

Taking $k \in \\{1,\ldots 5 \\}$ we can write down five degree four polynomials using a $5\times5$ matrix and column vector:

$$
\mathbf{M} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
b_{10} & b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13} &  b_{14} \\ 
b_{20} & b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{32} &  b_{24} \\
b_{30} & b_{31} & b_{32} & b_{33} &  b_{34} \\
b_{40} & b_{41} & b_{42} & b_{43} &  b_{44} \\
b_{50} & b_{51} & b_{52} & b_{53} &  b_{54} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\quad 
\mathbf{x} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
X^0 \\
X^1 \\
X^2 \\
X^3 \\
X^4 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

With these, our polynomials can be recovered from matrix multiplication:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
f^1(X) \\
f^2(X) \\
f^3(X) \\
f^4(X) \\
f^5(X) \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

To solve the challenge, our goal is to find a vector $\mathbf{a} = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4, \alpha_5)^\top$ such that 

$$
\mathbf{M}^\top(\mathbf{a}) = (1,0,0,0,0)^\top.
$$

This is equivalent to finding simultaneous solutions to

$$
\sum_{k=1}^5 \alpha_k \cdot b_{k0} = 1, \quad \sum_{k=1}^5 \alpha_k \cdot b_{kj} = 0, \quad j \in \{1,\ldots 4\}
$$

Practically, finding this vector $\mathbf{a}$, allows us to derive the linear combination

$$
g(m) = \sum_{i=1}^5 \alpha_i f^i(X) = \sum_{i=1}^5 \alpha_i \cdot m^i.
$$

with no dependency on the variable $X$, allowing us to understand $g(m)$ as a univariate polynomial in $m$, precisely what we need for small roots!!

Recovering $\mathbf{a}$ is possible as long as $\mathbf{M}$ has an inverse, as we can write

$$
\mathbf{a} = (\mathbf{M}^\top)^{-1} (1,0,0,0,0)^\top
$$

Using SageMath, this is as easy as

```python
M = ... # Matrix of coefficients
v = vector(Zmod(N), [1,0,0,0,0])
a = M.transpose().solve_right(v)
```

With the polynomial $g(m)$ recovered, we can apply SageMath's `.small_roots()` method on our univariate polynomial and recover the flag!
