# Projects

### CryptoHack

[CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org) is a fun, free platform for learning 
modern cryptography that I co-founded with 
[Hyperreality](https://github.com/hyperreality/ctf-writeups). We built the 
site with the vision of creating the resource we wished we had access to 
when we began studying cryptography. 

Along side the challenges, we have an amazing community on 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/eJaJ3xC), which I recommend joining if you 
have a Discord account and enjoy talking about maths / cryptography. 
Many people I have met there I now consider good friends. Occasionally, 
we work together under the name *CryptoHackers* and solve 
CTFs / Cryptography challenges. We built a 
[blog](https://blog.cryptohack.org/) for CryptoHack to keep track of the 
projects we do together.

### CRYSTALS-Python

Following NIST's decision to standardise the 
[CRYSTALS](https://pq-crystals.org)
primatives, I decided to write a pure Python implementation of both the 
key-encapsulation mechanism 
[https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/index.shtml](CRYSTALS-Kyber) 
and the digital signature scheme 
[CRYSTALS-Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/index.shtml).

The code was written as an educational aid and is totally unfit
for use in cryptographic applications. The hope is that the clean
implementation which closely follows the specification will serve as a
resource for those who wish to be familiar with *how* the primatives 
work.

### Breaking SIDH over Lunch

Working with [RÃ©my Oudompheng](https://twitter.com/oudomphe) 
and other members of the CryptoHack community,
I wrote a SageMath implementation of 
[An efficient key recovery attack on SIDH](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975.pdf),
based on the proof of concept Magma code, available at
[https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~wcastryc/](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~wcastryc/)

[Our implementation](https://github.com/jack4818/Castryck-Decru-SageMath) 
breaks `SIKEp434` in only 20 seconds, and `SIKEp751` in under one hour.

### CryptoBook

[CryptoBook](https://cryptohack.gitbook.io/cryptobook/) is a community 
project, developed by members of CryptoHack to create a written resource 
for people to learn cryptography. The focus of this project is to create 
an online textbook to serve as a friendly introduction to the mathematical 
fundamentals of cryptography.

If you're interested in contributing to the book, come chat to us in the 
[CryptoHack Discord channel](https://discord.gg/eJaJ3xC)

### Neutral Spaces

[Neutral Spaces](https://neutralspaces.co/) is a literary website I created 
to help contemporary writers by giving them an ad-free, zero cost space to 
host a portfolio. As the community grew, other projects such as a 
[blog](https://neutralspaces.co/blog) 
and a [writer's workshop](https://neutralspaces.co/workshop) have developed. 
Each year, the community comes together to create an online magazine with a 
range of fiction, poetry and essays.

- [Issue One: Celebration](https://neutralspaces.co/magazine/one/)
- [Issue Two: Doomscrolling](https://neutralspaces.co/magazine/two/)
- [Issue Three: The Advantages of Becoming a Father](https://neutralspaces.co/magazine/three/)

### Screaming into a Horse's Mouth

[Screaming into a Horse's Mouth](https://screamingintoahorsesmouth.com/) is a poetry 
website I curate. I think it is an incredible collection of poems and feel lucky 
to have been trusted to host the work of the poets I admire most.
