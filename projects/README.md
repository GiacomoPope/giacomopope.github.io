# Projects

### CryptoHack

[CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org) is a fun free platform for learning modern cryptography that I co-founded with [Hyperreality](https://github.com/hyperreality/ctf-writeups). We built the site with the vision of creating the resource we wished we had access to when we began studying cryptography. 

Along side the challenges, we have an amazing community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eJaJ3xC), which I recommend joining if you have a Discord account and enjoy talking about maths / cryptography. Many people I have met there I now consider a good friend. Occasionally, we work together as under the name *CryptoHackers* and solve CTFs / Cryptography challenges. We built a [blog](https://blog.cryptohack.org/) for CryptoHack to keep track of the projects we do together.

### CryptoBook

[CryptoBook](https://cryptohack.gitbook.io/cryptobook/) is a community project, developed by members of CryptoHack to create a written resource for people to learn cryptography. The focus of this project is to create an online textbook to serve as a friendly introduction to the mathematical fundamentals of cryptography.

If you're interested in contributing to the book, come chat to us in the [CryptoHack Discord channel](https://discord.gg/eJaJ3xC)

### Neutral Spaces

[Neutral Spaces](https://neutralspaces.co/) is a literary website which helps contemporary writers by giving them an ad-free, zero cost space to host a portfolio. As the community grew, other projects such as a [blog](https://neutralspaces.co/blog) and a [writer's workshop](https://neutralspaces.co/workshop) have developed. Each year, the community comes together to create an online magazine with a range of fiction, poetry and essays.

- [Issue Two: Doomscrolling](https://neutralspaces.co/magazine_two/)

### Screaming into a Horse's Mouth

[Screaming into a Horse's Mouth](https://screamingintoahorsesmouth.com/) is a poetry website I curate. I think it is an incredible collection of poems and feel lucky to have been trusted to host the work of the poets I admire most.

### Personal Work

I like to break up my mathematical research with creative projects. Most recently, I have been writing poetry. A collection of my published work on my [Neutral Spaces page](https://neutralspaces.co/giacomo/).
