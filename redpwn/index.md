# Redpwn CTF

I really enjoyed this CTF, only focused on the crypto, but had a good time and learnt a lot. Enough to bother doing this writeup at least

## 4K RSA

>Only n00bz use 2048-bit RSA. True gamers use keys that are at least 4k bits long, no matter how many primes it takes...

## Primimity

>People claim that RSA with two 1024-bit primes is secure. But I trust no one. That's why I use three 1024-bit primes.
>I even created my own prime generator to be extra cautious!

## Alien Transmissions V2

>The aliens are at it again! We've discovered that their communications are in base 512 and have transcribed them in base 10. However, it seems like they used XOR >encryption twice with two different keys! We do have some information:
>- This alien language consists of words delimitated by the character represented as 481
>- The two keys appear to be of length 21 and 19
>- The value of each character in these keys does not exceed 255
>- Find these two keys for me; concatenate their ASCII encodings and wrap it in the flag format.
>Find these two keys for me; concatenate their ASCII encodings and wrap it in the flag format.
