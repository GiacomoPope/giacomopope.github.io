        <h1>Holly & Jack’s Wedding</h1>

        <p>
            Hello everyone!
            <br><br>
            <em>We’re getting married!</em> For the past twenty months we’ve been enjoying being Heidi’s parents and slacking off organising a wedding since we got engaged back 2020. So, instead of waiting any longer, we thought we should just get a wiggle on and plan a party with all of you for the end of the summer!
            <br><br>
            We would <em>love</em> for you to spend the day with us, but also totally understand that you might already have plans for this weekend considering how we’re only just letting everyone know. 
            <br><br>
            Our plan is to keep things relaxed, as we want Heidi to have her best day too! We hope to be all finished by 7pm so we can get Heidi into bed on time, which hopefully also gives most of you a chance to get home to your new week.
            <br><br>
            The ceremony itself starts at 12:30pm, so we’re suggesting everyone arrives at midday and afterwards we’ll all be off to Mimmo studios to eat some food and spend time together. The two venues are about a five minute walk apart, and there’s a park right outside for those who might need a break to run around and enjoy some trees, flowers or climbing frames.
            <br><br>
            We are working on getting parking and travel details on this web page along with some timings etc. If anyone has any burning questions about anything though, feel free to reach out to either of us.
            <br><br>
            Lots of love to you all, hope to see you in September!
            <br><br>

        <h3>Travelling by Car</h3>

        </p>

        <h4>Car Parks</h4>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Travelling by Train</h3>

        Cheltenham also has a train station, Cheltenham Spa, which has direct trains to/from Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, 
        London and Nottingham and also other places!

        <h4>Taxis</h4>
        <p>
            We recommend Starline taxis, not for any reason other than we arbitarily picked them when we first moved here and they've always 
            been great.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can book a taxi by calling (01242 250250). Leave about 10 minutes to get a Taxi to or from the station. 
            They quoted £7-8 for the fare one way.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Starline Taxis: (01242 250250)</b>: <a href="https://starlinetaxis.com", target="_blank">https://starlinetaxis.com</a></li>
