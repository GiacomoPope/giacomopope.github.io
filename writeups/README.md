# Writeups

Here is a collection of write ups and discussions of the challenges I have solved in various capture the flag competitions. The focus is usually the cryptographic challenges.

## Misc

Some other CTF-like problems I've looked into, with some code and thoughts (*this is very much a work in progress*).

### Elliptic Curves

- [Supersingular curves with prime characteristic](/tools/mov.html)
- [Supersingular curves with composite characteristic](/misc/superprime/)
- [Generating curves with pseudoprime order](/redpwn/#jeopardy)
- [Smart's attack for anomalous curves](/hsctf-2019/#spooky-ecc)
